<h1>Elatedly, I extend my greetings to one and all, along with an assuring hope that your experience at St. Francis School, Indirapuram, Ghaziabad will always be exhilarating and enriching.

Having given an opportunity to set sail with this prestigious institution, I am delighted that the school's values align with my own values, including the importance of trust, respect and a sense of community. I know that the development of the school over the past 14 years has been significant and its future will be built on these strong foundations, focusing on the quality of the school life for the benefit of our learners.

In the contemporary era of striving for excellence in every domain of life, success is synonymous with grit, perseverance and faith in oneself. While the cognitive aspect is given prime attention in the school, the emotional and behavioural compatibility is not ignored. A proper balance is struck between an individual's achievement with that of one's roots and moral values, which would enable each and every student to become a successful human being.</h1>
